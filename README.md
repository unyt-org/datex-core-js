The DATEX Core Library for JavaScript (DATEX Core JS) is based on the
[DATEX Core](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-core) rust library and provides a
high-level API for working with DATEX in JavaScript and TypeScript. DATEX is
developed and maintained by the [unyt.org](https://unyt.org) organization and
community.

You can find the legacy version of the DATEX Core library (implemented in
TypeScript) at
[unyt-org/datex-core-js-legacy](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-core-js-legacy).
The legacy version is still actively maintained and supported until this library
reaches feature parity.
